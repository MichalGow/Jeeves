# Jeeves - AI GP Appointment Booking System

**Standalone script using Twilio SIP + OpenAI Realtime API for natural phone conversations.**

## üéØ What It Does

Jeeves makes automated calls to GP practices to book appointments using natural conversation AI. The system connects via Twilio SIP, uses OpenAI's Realtime API for speech-to-speech conversation, and saves complete call logs and recordings.

**Key Features:**
- ü§ñ **Natural conversation** powered by OpenAI Realtime API (speech-to-speech)
- üìû **Twilio SIP integration** for real phone calls
- üéôÔ∏è **Server-side recording** with dual-channel audio (caller + practice)
- üìÅ **Local call logs** with timestamped folders
- ‚è∞ **Call scheduling** with timezone support
- üìã **Clean transcripts** and conversation logs
- ‚öôÔ∏è **Simple configuration** via `.env` file

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

**Python Version:** This project requires **Python 3.13.4** (specified in `.python-version`)

**Why Python 3.13.4?**
- Latest Python with performance improvements
- Compatible with all dependencies (pjsua2, OpenAI, etc.)
- Tested and working with the current package versions

### 1. Installation

```bash
# Clone or navigate to the project directory
cd jeeves

# Option A: Using pyenv (recommended)
pyenv install 3.13.4
# pyenv will automatically use this version due to .python-version file

# Option B: Without pyenv
# Make sure you have Python 3.13.4 installed system-wide

# Verify Python version
python --version  # Should show: Python 3.13.4

# Create virtual environment (recommended)
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Don't have pyenv?** Install it first:
```bash
# macOS
brew install pyenv

# Linux
curl https://pyenv.run | bash
```

### 2. Set up Twilio SIP

You need a Twilio account with:
- **Phone number** for outbound calls
- **SIP Domain** configured
- **SIP credentials** (username/password)

### 3. Configure Everything in `.env`

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in your details.


### 4. Run Jeeves

```bash
# Make an appointment booking call
python gpt-5-test.py
```

## üìÅ Output Structure

Each call creates a timestamped folder in `calls/`:

```
calls/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ 22-09-25_18-11-27/        # DD-MM-YY_HH-MM-SS format
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ call.txt              # Clean conversation transcript
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ log.txt               # System logs and events
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ console.log           # PJSIP debug output
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ pjsip.log             # Detailed SIP protocol logs
```

### Sample `call.txt`:

```
JEEVES: Good morning, this is Jeeves calling to book an appointment for John Doe.
GP: Hi, what can I help you with?
JEEVES: I'd like to book an appointment for John Doe. His date of birth is 15th March 1985.
GP: What's the appointment for?
JEEVES: It's for a routine checkup.
GP: I have availability next Tuesday at 10:30 AM, would that work?
JEEVES: That sounds perfect. Please book that appointment.
GP: All done, the reference is GP12345.
JEEVES: Thank you very much. Goodbye.
```

## üéôÔ∏è Natural Conversation Flow

The AI handles everything naturally:

```
üéß "Hello, City Medical Practice"
ü§ñ "Hi, I'd like to book an appointment for John Doe"

üéß "What's the appointment for?"
ü§ñ "It's for a routine checkup"

üéß "What's his date of birth?"
ü§ñ "15th of March, 1985"

üéß "I have Monday at 10:30 AM, would that work?"
ü§ñ "Perfect, that's in my preferred morning slot. Please book it."
```

## üéôÔ∏è Call Recordings

The system automatically enables **Twilio server-side recording** with dual-channel audio:
- **Channel 1**: Jeeves (AI assistant)
- **Channel 2**: GP practice receptionist

The recordings can be accessed in Twilio account, Monitor section > Call recordings.

### Download Recordings

Use the included script to locally download MP3 recordings:

```bash
# Download all recent recordings
python get-recordings.py
```

**Output:**

ls calls/
cat calls/22-09-25_18-11-27/call.txt

# Download recordings
python get-recordings.py
ls recordings/
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Problem: Call fails to connect**
- Check Twilio SIP credentials are correct
- Verify SIP domain is properly configured in Twilio
- Ensure phone numbers have correct country codes

**Problem: No audio/conversation doesn't work**
- Check OpenAI API key is valid
- Verify `pjsua2` is properly installed
- Look at `pjsip.log` for detailed SIP debugging

**Problem: Recording not available**
- Recordings take 1-2 minutes to process after call ends
- Check the Call SID in logs matches the recording
- Use `get-recordings.py` to download manually

**Problem: Environment variables not loading**
- Ensure `.env` file exists (copy from `.env.example`)
- No quotes needed around values in `.env`
- Check file is in the same directory as the script

### Installation Issues

**Problem: `pjsua2` installation fails**
```bash
# macOS - install via Homebrew first
brew install pjproject
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Linux - install development headers
sudo apt-get install libpjproject-dev
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Problem: Permission errors on macOS**
```bash
# Accept Xcode license if prompted
sudo xcodebuild -license agree
```
